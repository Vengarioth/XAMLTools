# XAMLTools

Working with WPF for a long time now, i really got to like XAML. I'd like to use it for more than just markup, it has great potential for modeling object graphs.

##Why a new set of tools?
I know XML was built arround the idea that it is possible to parse it without REGEX. It only needs the current and the next character to determine the type of symbol. I wonder if it is possible to parse XAML this way (i think it is, because the .NET XAML tools are build upon the XML namespace.)

##State of this code
Currently everything is proof of concept

##Licence (code in this repository)
"Do what the f*** you want with it"!

##XAML Licence (?)
There are some rumors microsoft didn't like other people to incorporate XAML outside the .NET toolchain. With the current movement towards open source i think this is no longer valid, if it ever was. If someone has information about the state of affairs concirning XAMLs licence, please contact me!
